Repository includes a data folder, the R project, and associated code files. This could serve as a framework for other water quality projects provided your datasets are relevant to the statistical analyses done below. 

craine-cslap.R = linear regression models of long-term citizen science water quality data

craine-hypso.R = hypsographic curve based on lake volume

craine-ion-lines.R = depth profiles of ion data from laboratory analyses

craine-linegraphs.R = depth profiles using seasonal YSI data 

craine-nutrient-lines.R = depth profiles of nutrient data from laboratory analyses

shea_zoop.R = zooplankton biomass by genera based on empirical dry weight formulas
